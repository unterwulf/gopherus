 * Building instructions *

 There is nothing particular to know about the building process of Gopherus.
 It's shipped with Makefile files for different operating systems, therefore
 the whole thing would be about using the right one.

 
 * What compiler to use *
  
 Or, should I say, what I used to compile Gopherus:
  DOS: DJGPP (+Watt32)
  Linux: gcc (+SDL)
  Windows: Mingw (+SDL)


 * Dependencies *

  DOS
    The DOS version relies on the Watt32 library for all network operations.
  Linux & Windows
    Non-DOS version are built against SDL to emulate a pseudo terminal. All
    network operations are performed using classic BSD sockets.
