 Stuff that I'd like to get done on Gopherus (but probably won't ever have time to do it)

  - Display graphic files (bmp, png, jpg, gif..)
  - command line download mode (--saveto)
  - configuration file (for memory settings)
  - timeout and user cancel when in connecting... phase
  - timeout and user cancel when in resolving... phase
  - Bookmarks
  - recognize GET pseudo-http-selectors (not sure anyone uses them anymore..)
  - UTF8 support
  - IPv6 support
